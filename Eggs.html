		<h1>Nate's Recipes - My Yummy Scrambled Eggs</h1>
			<p>I made this recipe after years of perfection.
				
				I have since transformed it into what I really believe are
				the <em>best </em>scrambled eggs ever!</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<p>The following ingredients make one serving:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> 4-6 eggs</li>
					<li> 1 cup of cheese </li >
					<li> 1/3 cup of 1% milk<i>(2 3/4 fl ounces) </i> </li>
					<li> A pinch of Salt </li >
					<li> Freshly milled Black Pepper </li>
					<li> About 1/2 tbs of Paprika </li>
					</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> Whisk eggs, milk, paprika, pepper and salt in a bowl. </li>
			<li> Heat a medium size frying pan </li>
			<li> Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around
					the edge of the pan (around 60 seconds). </li>
			<li> Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it
					were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds. </li>
			<li> Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until
					the eggs are only just done. </li >
			<li> Lightly sprinkling of cheese over the eggs</li>
				<li>  And serve right away with crispy bacon! </li>
				
	   </ol>
		<p> You should only make a <strong> maximum </strong> of two servings per
				frying pan. </p>
